## Description
This is a front end I implemented on top of the backend my group built for the final project of the Netflix Pathways Bootcamp. It uses Spring, React, MySql, and Java JPA to manage an inventory for a game store.

the front end is a work in progress. The backend is fully functional and implements all CRUD operations, Querying with GraphQL, and JPA.
